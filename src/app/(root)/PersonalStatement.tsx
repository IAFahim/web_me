                    I am Bushra Hossain, the eldest and only daughter of my parents. From a young age, I was inspired by
                    a doctor and wanted to help people by pursuing the same profession. My ambition guided my early
                    academic progress, but at a crossroads in life, I was introduced to Computer Science and Engineering
                    (CSE). Initially, this shift left me feeling lost and uncertain. However, this changed with the
                    introduction of Machine Learning (ML) during my undergraduate studies. This was a turning point in
                    my life to finally grasp this field. <TextCycleOnHold
                    text={childHoodLinkCycle.currentText}
                    title={childHoodLinkCycle.title}
                    action={childHoodLinkCycle.cycleToNextText}/> As
                    a quiet child, I spent hours imagining a beautiful world around me, which stayed with me into
                    adulthood. At a young age, I was pretty athletic and enjoyed playing badminton and cricket.
                    Still, I couldn't continue due to disciplinary action from my parents, as I used to get lost in
                    those
                    activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated from a top university in Bangladesh, North South University. CSE was the subject of
                    code,
                    and I
                    got into it not knowing what it was from my relatives' assessment. Beforehand, I knew I didn't like
                    programming from my experience in college. And I was faced with something I disliked a lot. I didn't
                    have a
                    chance to view its importance, and I wandered around the campus wall, thinking about life and making
                    sense
                    of everything. My path to embracing CSE was not easy, and I had to learn to cope with the situation.
                    After
                    that, I started getting the admiration of my teachers and did quite well in my studies, which were
                    the
                    source of my pride and determination. During that time, I placed my trust in a female classmate, and
                    we
                    attempted to take on AI as my research subject. Unfortunately, I was abandoned by the person, and
                    with
                    my
                    boat leaving me, I felt stranded on the shore, still hoping to get to the other side of the river
                    without
                    having experience. For the first time in my life, I got an F in my course. Failing hard, I wanted my
                    life
                    decisions to be written by me, and I enrolled in courses focused on ML and AI. It was different
                    seeing a
                    machine guessing like a human, where there are so many paths to explore. I recovered and found a
                    goal in
                    life. For the first time, I was interested in computer science. But the study time at this
                    university is
                    over. And I want to see what the world has in store.

                    Around my final year, I learned the value of teamwork and got a chance to motivate others. I also
                    got to do a virtual internship at Mysoft Limited & eSRD-Lab, BUET, with enhanced data analytical
                    skills and the ability to work under pressure. I have faced different types of technology and
                    visualisation libraries. With an elevated view, I learned about recent advancements in computer
                    hardware in <TextCycleOnHold

                    currently fully available in Bangladesh. Therefore, I want to study abroad to be on the emerging
                    side of this technology. The UK, a hub of cultures, knowledge, and history, inspired me to look for
                    a suitable university there. <TextCycleOnHold

                    During my undergraduate studies, I was lucky to be part of ACM and ACM-W. Because I was comfortable
                    with administrative tasks, I quickly got promoted to being In-Charge. I was shocked to discover that
                    skill in me. Currently, I am studying advanced Python and practising Deep Learning, LLM, and AI
                    Agents, hoping to be helpful as soon as I join my higher studies. For my journey, I would have to
                    leave my life here to travel to a different place to study. However, travelling has been a passion
                    of mine since I was young. Travelling and visiting a new place always gives me a rush of lasting
                    happiness, a thing I learned by going to every corner of my homeland and a few other places. Given
                    the chance, I would be a valuable student at your university and get the required skills and
                    mentorship. I am eager to get the opportunity to be a part of this next generation of human
                    achievement.
